# Printing
# You can print strings
print("hi") 
print()
# You can print integers
print(5)
print(235.45)
# You can print other things

5+10-2 #This won't display since we are not printing it

# Math and types
1 # integer. it is a whole number that can be negative
-10 # still an integer

5.1 # floats, floating point number (decimals)

"Hi there 12345" # this is a string,m it can be any set of characters including whitespace
print("\"") # You can escape special characters with a backslash

True # this is a boolean, they are either true or false

# Integer math, including string usage (characters for display purposes, not executed functions)
print("5+5=", 5+5) # outputs 5+5= 10
print("5-5+", 5-5)
print("5/5=", 5/5) #division, yields float
print("5/6=", 5/6) #division, yields float
print("5//6=", 5//6) #integer division that truncates the result. returns an integer
# modulus division (this yields the remainder of the division)
print("5%3=",5%3) #should return 2
print("3%5=",3%5) #should return 3 (essentially 0 remainder 3/5 so 3 is returned)

print("5*5=",5*5)
print("2**4=",2**4) #2 raised to the power of 4 (exponent)
